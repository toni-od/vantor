# vantor

## description

A project that aims to create a collaborative platform. The application will host shared spaces where people can edit files real-time as they discuss issues quicker and progressively. An ideal situation would have been the use of version control systems but the problem with version control systems is the lack of exclusive rights  over a resource. Unlike VCSs where you have to put in place rules to avoid stepping on each others toes, this system will allow users to agree on who has the right to what resource and at what time.
